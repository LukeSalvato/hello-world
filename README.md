# hello-world


## Hi everyone,

I'm Luke. 

I study land use change in California's Central Valley, an important agricultural region that sustains the livelihoods of nearly one million ag. workers and generates over $50 billion annually in revenue. I use remotely sensed data to quantify agricultural land use changes in this region and I employ machine learning methods to determine what role climate, soil type, and economics play in driving these changes.
