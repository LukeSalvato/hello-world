## I'm Luke. 

I study land use change in California's Central Valley, an important agricultural region that employs nearly one million workers and generates more than $50 billion annually. I use remote sensing methods to quantify agricultural land use changes in this region and I employ machine learning methods to determine what role climate, soil type, and economics play in driving these changes.
